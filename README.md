Deck of Cards

Practice with classes

This creates a class Card with attributes suit and value and a method that returns black or red depending on the suit.

It also creates a class Deck with an attribute cards. It makes the instance variable @cards into an array of members of the Card class. They can be created/defined within class Deck.
Then initialize calls the method shuffle_deck that is defined in the class.

It creates two more methods, draw_card and chaos_orb. draw_card picks one at random, chaos_orb picks one at random and removes it from the array @cards.
